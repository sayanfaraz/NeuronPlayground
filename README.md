# NeuronPlayground
An interactive simulation of neurons firing!

## Why?
This project was inspired by what I learnt in PHY254: Mechanics-From Oscillations to Chaos. We dealt with various types of linear and nonlinear oscillators, and I learnt in that class that neurons can actually be modelled as a nonlinear oscillator! All you need is to time-step through a few nonlinear differential equations (which isn't too too bad as long as you don't have too many neurons in the system) and you get to see live neurons interacting with each other!
